I made this simple CRM ( and still work on ) with:
- python
- pglet library (works in browser )

What is working:
- adding client to database
- adding insurances to database
- adding car data to database
- viewing clients insurances


What needs to be done:
- searching clients
- searching insurances
- viewing upcoming instalments
- viewing ending insurances
- predict product to offer 
- e-mail delivery
- statistics
- reminders
- code is sketchy so it needs a cleanup or full rewrite 

Currently program works using sqlite3 database. Ultimately it will work on mysql database.
